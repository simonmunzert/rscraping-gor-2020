# A Primer to Web Scraping

## General information

**Summary**

The rapid growth of the World Wide Web over the past two decades tremendously changed  the way we share, collect and publish data. Firms, public institutions and private users provide every imaginable type of information and new channels of communication generate vast amounts of data on human behavior. What was once a fundamental problem for the social sciences---the scarcity and inaccessibility of observations---is quickly turning into an abundance of data. This turn of events does not come without problems. For example, traditional techniques for collecting and analyzing data may no longer suffice to overcome the tangled masses of data. One consequence of the need to make sense of such data has been the inception of `data scientists', who sift through data and are greatly sought after by research and business alike.

But how to efficiently collect data from the Internet, retrieve information from social networks, search engines, and dynamic web pages, tap web services, and, finally, process the collected data with statistical software? We will learn how to scrape content from static web pages and connect to APIs from popular web services.

## Accompanying book
Together with Christian Rubba, Peter Meissner, and Dominic Nyhuis, I've written a book on [Automated Data Collection with R](http://r-datacollection.com). Participants of the course might find it useful to consult it as further reading after the course. As a documentation of the course work, this code archive and the accompanying reader is fully sufficient though.


## Technical setup for the course

Please make sure that the current version of R is installed. If not, update from here: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

Obviously, feel free to choose the coding environment you feel most comfortable with. I'll use RStudio in the course. You might want to use it, too: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

We are going to need a couple of packages from CRAN: You can install them all by running the R source file `packages.r` which you can find in the code folder.
